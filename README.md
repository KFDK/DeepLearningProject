# DeepLearningProject
Final project for 02456 Deep Learning at Technical University of Denmark.

The title of the project is "GAMING IN 2020: COMPARING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS - PPO VS TRULY PPO". 

The project investigates and compares the two reinforcement learning algorithms Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an extension of it called Truly PPO on two Procgen atari-likegames, namely Starpilot and Chaser. The foundation of our work is by Y. Wang et al. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07940. 

## Description of Files
**s174466_s174210_tr_ppo_rb.py:** The main script that trains and evaluates the agent. It can be used for both PPO and Truly PPO. All settings in terms of algorithm, environment, hyperparameters etc. are placed at the top of the code.  

**s174466_s174210_tr_ppo_rb.ipynb:** Notebook version of main script. 

**utils_savior.py:** A modified version of utils.py by Nicklas Hansen. It is a bunch of utility functions used for deep RL projects. 

**s174210_s174466_02456DeepLearning_RL_ProjectA_Paper.pdf:** The corresponding paper. 

**s174210_s174466_02456DeepLearning_RL_ProjectA_Poster.pdf** The corresponding poster
